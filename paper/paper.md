# Summary

There are a number of astrophysical processes that can significantly alter the
orbits of planets during and after their formation. Some of these mechanisms are
thought to be responsible for misaligning the planetary orbit with respect to the stellar
rotation axis, while others are expected to produce coplanar systems. 
Measuring the sky-projected spin-orbit angle (stellar obliquity) 
has become commonplace,
as these measurement have the potential to inform us of the formation, migration
and dynamical histories of exoplanets. In most cases, the stellar obliquity is
measured from the spectroscopic Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during transit.
