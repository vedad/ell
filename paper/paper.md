# Summary

There are a number of astrophysical processes that can significantly alter the
orbits of planets during and after their formation. Some of these mechanisms are
thought to misalign the planetary orbit with respect to
the rotation axis of its host star, while others are expected to produce coplanar
systems.
Measuring the sky-projected spin-orbit angle (stellar obliquity) 
has become commonplace in exoplanet science,
as these measurement have the potential to inform us of the formation, migration
and dynamical histories of exoplanets. 

# Statement of need

*elle* is a package for computing models of the local surface velocities on a 
stellar disc. The code can also include the effect of latitudinal
differential rotation on the star, as well as centre-to-limb convective
blueshift 
variations due to the varying line-of-sight velocities from surface granulation. 

In most cases, the stellar obliquity is
measured from the spectroscopic Rossiter-McLaughlin (R-M) effect. 
The planet covers parts of the stellar disc during its transit, which
has the effect of distorting the absorption line profile of the star. Despite it
being a spectroscopic effect, most existing codes treat the R-M effect as a
shift in the radial (Doppler) velocity of the star, following some
analytical approximations. Many of these codes also neglect
latitudinal differential rotation of the star, and convective

need:

- better instruments, sensitive to differential rotation, convective effects,
  can bias the spin-orbit angle by 10-20 deg. 
- targeting smaller systems: reloaded RM has better potential to model the 
- several existing models for the reloaded RM effect, but spatially resolving
  the planet-occulted light gives a direct method
